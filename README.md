# Invoice Generator

This project is a clone of an invoice generator website created as part of a hackathon challenge. Notably, approximately 98% of the code was written by GitHub Copilot with the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model.

## Features

Beyond the standard invoice generation capabilities, we've added three innovative features:

1. **Chatbot** - A conversational interface with static hardcoded responses currently, but designed to be integrated with a backend system in the future.

2. **Suggest Items** - A feature meant to read already added items and suggest further relevant items. Currently implemented with hardcoded suggestions.

3. **Genie Invoice** - Takes user prompts in natural language and generates invoices accordingly. Currently provides static responses.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
